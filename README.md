From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

In this project I learned how to:
-Efficiently layout objects with css
-Use another site as inspiration
-Use floats and absolute positions in order to place the nav bar and footer
-Use drop shaddows
-Change objects when the mouse is over them
-HTML and CSS problem solving
